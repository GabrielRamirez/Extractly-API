Sure! Here's a basic example of how you can structure your `README.md` file. This includes a brief description of the tool, how to install it, how to use it and what kind of output to expect.

# Web Scraper API

This project is a web scraper API built with Python, Flask, Beautiful Soup, and html2text. It scrapes content from any web page and returns the content in Markdown format.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4 html2text
```

## API Usage

Start the server by running `python main.py` in your terminal (where `main.py` is the Python file of your Flask application). This will start the server on http://localhost:5000.

The application has one endpoint - `/v1/url` which accepts a GET request with a `url` query parameter.

Example:
```
http://localhost:5000/v1/url?url=http://example.com
```

## Output

After making the GET request with a URL, you will receive a JSON response. The `content` field in the JSON response will contain the main content of the webpage in Markdown format.

Example:
```
{
  "content": "# Title\n\nThis is some text from the example.com homepage.\n\n* And a bullet point\n\n> And a quote"
}
```

If an error occurs during the request, you will receive an error message in the `error` field.

Example:
```
{
  "error": "Invalid URL 'http: ww//': No schema supplied. Perhaps you meant http://http: ww//?"
}
```
